## Introduction to NoSQL Databases: A Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey through IBM's "Introduction to NoSQL Databases" course on Coursera! This course is part of the  NoSQL, Big Data, and Spark Foundations Specialization, and I'm excited to dive deep into the world of NoSQL.

**About this Repository**

This repository serves as a central hub for my coursework, including:

* **Practice Labs:** Practical exercises and coding assignments demonstrating my understanding of NoSQL concepts.
* **Notes & Reflections:**  My personal notes and reflections on each module, highlighting key takeaways and insights.

**Course Curriculum**

The course is structured into 5 comprehensive modules:

**Module 1: Introducing NoSQL**

* **What's included:** 11 videos, 2 readings, 4 assignments, 8 plugins
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Understanding what NoSQL is and its distinctions from traditional SQL databases.
    * Exploring the four main categories of NoSQL databases: document, key-value, column-family, and graph.
    * Comparing and contrasting ACID and BASE consistency models.
    * Delving into the principles of distributed systems, including advantages, challenges, and the CAP theorem.
    * Determining when to leverage NoSQL vs. RDBMS for specific use cases.

**Module 2: Introducing MongoDB: An Open-Source NoSQL Database**

* **What's included:** 8 videos, 2 readings, 4 assignments, 5 app items, 3 plugins
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Deep dive into MongoDB, a popular document-oriented NoSQL database.
    * Mastering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB.
    * Implementing and utilizing indexes for efficient data retrieval.
    * Leveraging MongoDB's aggregation framework for data analysis.
    * Understanding replication and sharding for scalability and high availability.
    * Accessing and interacting with MongoDB using Python.

**Module 3: Introducing Apache Cassandra: An Open-Source NoSQL Database**

* **What's included:** 10 videos, 2 readings, 4 assignments, 4 app items, 3 plugins
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Exploring Apache Cassandra, a NoSQL database renowned for high availability and scalability.
    * Understanding the key features and use cases of Cassandra.
    * Deep dive into Cassandra's data model and query language (CQL).
    * Performing keyspace and table operations within Cassandra.
    * Executing CRUD operations using CQL.

**Module 4: Final Project: Working with NoSQL Databases**

* **What's included:** 2 readings, 1 assignment, 1 peer review, 2 app items, 2 plugins
* **Project Focus:**
    * Consolidating knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course by tackling a real-world NoSQL scenario.
    * Demonstrating proficiency in applying NoSQL concepts to solve practical problems.
    * Receiving peer feedback on the project to enhance understanding and implementation.

**Module 5: [Optional] Introducing IBM Cloudant: A NoSQL DBaaS**

* **What's included:** 8 videos, 3 readings, 2 assignments, 3 app items, 5 plugins
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Understanding Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) and its relevance in cloud computing.
    * Exploring IBM Cloudant, a fully managed DBaaS built on Apache CouchDB.
    * Discovering how Cloudant simplifies web and mobile application development.
    * Getting hands-on experience with Cloudant's features and capabilities.
    * Learning how to manage a Cloudant database using its intuitive dashboard.
